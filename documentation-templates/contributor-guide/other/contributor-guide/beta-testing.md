# Beta Testing Guide

Beta testing of development versions is a valuable contribution to the project. You can help to ensure the quality of the production release that will be distributed to the user community.

---

‚ùó Make sure to always download the newest available development version of the project in order to ensure effective results from your beta testing efforts.

---

Beta testing is done during both the pull request and pre-release phases of development:

## Testing Pull Requests

<!-- TODO: Add instructions for testing PRs -->

### Feedback

Feedback after beta testing a pull request is always valuable, regardless of which categories your findings fall under:

- working as expected
- problems encountered
- areas for improvement

Please submit feedback related to the changes made in the pull request as a PR review:

https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews

---

If you discover problems or areas for improvement that are unrelated to the changes made by the PR (i.e., they also occur when using the [pre-release](#testing-pre-release) version), please submit that feedback as an issue report instead of a review.
