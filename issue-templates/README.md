# GitHub issue templates

A menu of issue categories will be presented when the user begins the issue creation process. This "template chooser" also contains links to relevant information, which can redirect support requests or other inappropriate/unproductive uses of the issue tracker.

A link to the default organization level [security policy](https://docs.github.com/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) (using [the default organization-level one](https://docs.github.com/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) if one is not present for the repository) is displayed in the template chooser, helping to ensure that vulnerability disclosures are done according to policy.

If none of the issue types are applicable, the user can click the "Open a blank issue" link at the bottom of the issue template chooser page to get the previous issue creation behavior.

The issue will be automatically labeled on creation according to the configuration of the template.

The templates can pre-fill the issue body with text prompting the reporter to provide the standardized details required for every issue of that type.

Each subfolder contains a set of issue templates for a specific application. Documentation is provided in each, which includes:

- Installation instructions
- Stock commit and pull request messages
