# Issue template chooser configurations

The template chooser is presented to the contributor when creating an issue in a repository that uses [issue templates](https://docs.github.com/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository).

This chooser can be customized by adding a [configuration file](https://docs.github.com/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser). This allows redirecting support requests via "Contact Links".

Each subfolder contains an issue template chooser configuration for a specific application. Documentation is provided in each, which includes:

- Installation instructions
- Stock commit and pull request messages
