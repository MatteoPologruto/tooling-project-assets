# GitHub issue form configuration files

GitHub's issue form system offers the option of presenting the contributor with a web form when creating an issue.

These forms can consist of several input field types including multi-line fields with the same formatting and attachment capabilities as the standard GitHub Issue composer, in addition to menus and checkboxes where appropriate.

The form is configured via a YAML file. Reusable issue form configuration files designed for each project type are stored under the folders. See their individual readmes for instructions.
